## ABOUT
Hello there! Welcome to my webpage. I am a graduate student currently pursuing my PhD in Materials Science and Engineering at the Multiphysics Lab, Arizona State University. My research journey at ASU advised by Prof. Kiran Solanki over the past few years has been focusing on understanding the mechanical and irradiation properties of metallic alloys using advanced microscopy and mechanical characterizations.

Outside of my research, I love to hike, cook and constantly strive to improve my average singing skills.
